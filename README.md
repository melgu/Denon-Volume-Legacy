Enter the device IP or network name into the text field and confirm using the return key. If you have a newer AVR, you might have to include the port 8080 like in this example: `192.168.1.30:8080`.

## Download

You can download the latest version [here](https://github.com/melgu/Denon-Volume/releases).
After downloading and unpacking the Denon-Volume.zip, move the app to the Applications folder. If you get a GateKeeper warning on first launch, right-click the app, select open and confirm your action in the dialog popping up. Sometimes this needs to be done twice. Alternatively you can allow the app in System Settings -> Security.
